# graal-cli-template

Use this template to quickly get up and running with a new Graal VM native image Clojure app.

The `initiate.sh` script will move some files and replace some lines to quickly rename your project, but it's only tested on my local Mac, so use it at your own peril.

## Example

``` sh
$ ./initiate.sh xyz.thoren graal-cli-template
```
